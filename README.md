## Overview of Express User Documentation

Welcome to the beginner's guide to using Terminal on your Mac OS computer.

## Tools we used while the collaboration

### Git and GitHub
We used Git and GitHub to control the version of our draft and the documentation. We deployed the documentation through GitHub action.

### MkDocs
We used MkDocs theme as our static site generator as we felt it has well organized documentation and useful components that we would like to implement on our documentation. 

### Markdown
We have experience of writing short markdown documents from the `README` file for programs we made. However, we learned further about how to style a document which consists of several pages by using markdown from COMM 2116 Business Communications 2. We have applied our skills to writing this documentation.

### Visual Studio Code
We used Visual Studio Code to write our markdown files. We previewed the markdown page using VS Code's built-in markdown preview, but we had to render our document with MkDocs to confirm the accurate result. We use `mkdocs serve` on the Python Terminal.

### Style Guide

We used codeblocks to represent code snippets. We also used admonition, and emoji extensions which are offered by MkDocs. This allowed us to emphasize specific tip or warning messages. 

## Tone
This documentation is intended for novice developers or students who are not familiar with the Terminal environment and command line.


## Conclusion

This documentation introduces where to start and what to practice if you have never used the Terminal before. Icons in a computer screen are easy to navigate folders and files, but utilizing Terminal is faster and accurate in some cases.  

Thank you for your time reading this document. Hope this documentation can be a good beginner guide for new students of BCIT CST.
