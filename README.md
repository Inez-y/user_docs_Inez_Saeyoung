# Tools we used while the collaboration

### Git and GitHub
We used Git and GitHub to collaborate on the documentation. We deployed the documentation through GitHub action.

Our guide was created using our knowledge from setting up and using... 

### MkDocs
We used MkDocs theme as our static site generator as we felt it has well organized documentation and useful components that we would like to implement on our documentation. 

### Markdown
This was the first time writing extensively in markdown for two of our three group members. We learned how to style text using markdown from our COMM 2116 Business Communications 2 and developed our skills over the course of writing this documentation.

### VS Code
All three members of the group used VS Code to write our markdown files. We previewed the markdown using VS Code's built-in markdown preview, but we had to serve our guide with MkDocs to see the accurate rendering of our styles.

### Style Guid

We used codeblocks to represent code. MkDocs allowed us to make annotations inside the code block that show additional information when clicked. This allowed us to explain specific lines of code without disrupting the visual flow. MkDocs also had the feature to highlight lines of code. We used this feature to highlight new additions or changes to a repeating code block.

We used a quote block to visually differentiate Terminal commands from code.
