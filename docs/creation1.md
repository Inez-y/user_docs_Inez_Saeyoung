# Creation

## Overview

Our goal of this section is go to a destination folder, and create a folder and a file. To do so, first, go to a destination folder. Second, create a folder, and a file through the terminal. Finally, we will see how to check the folder and file is made.

### Navigate to Documents folder 

1. Type `cd /Users/[user_name]/Documents` to navigate `Documents` folder.

2. Type `pwd` to confirm your current location. If you are in the `Documents` folder, proceed to the next step.


### Create a folder and file

1. Type following command to create a folder. Replace `new_folder` to make a folder of your own title. `mkdir` represents `make directory`.

     ```
     mkdir new_folder
     ```

2. Type `ls` to see `new_folder` or the title you have entered is created. If you can see a new folder is created, proceed to the next step.


3. Type following command to create a file. Replace `new_file` to make a file of your own title. 

    ```
    touch new_file.txt
    ```

4. Type `ls` to see `new_file` or the title you have entered is created. 

!!! note

    Ensure you put extension to a new file name. For example, `file_1.txt` or `file_2.docx`
