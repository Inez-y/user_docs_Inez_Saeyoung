# Navigating the Terminal (macOS) for Beginners

## How to Navigate Directories with Command Line

### Step 1: Determining Your Current Location

To determine your current directory, use the `pwd` (print working directory) command:

`bash`
`pwd`

### Step 2: Introducing Navigation Commands

To navigate directories, you'll primarily use the cd (change directory) command. Here's how it works:

```
cd [directory_name]
```

Replace [directory_name] with the name of the directory you want to navigate to.

### Step 3: Common Mistakes and Cautions

Ensure you type directory names correctly, including proper capitalization.
Be cautious when using relative paths (e.g., cd .. to move up one directory), as it can lead to unintended movements.

### Step 4: Examples of Navigation

To move into a directory named "Documents," type:

```
cd Documents
```
