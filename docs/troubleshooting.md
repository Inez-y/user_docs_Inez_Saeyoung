| Wrong Path                                                | You try to access a folder or execute a command from an incorrect location.                                                     | Double-check the command syntax for accuracy. Type the `pwd` command and `ls` to verify your current folder. If you are in the wrong folder, navigate to the correct folder using the `cd` command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Invalid Syntax                                            | You have a typo in your command or missing part of command.                                                                     | If the error message specified the correction, type the corrected command. Otherwise, Look up the command or function causing the error for proper usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| zsh: command not found                                    | You have a typo, or you are in an incorrect folder, or a specific package or software not installed on your computer or folder. | Check the typo or syntax and ensure correct command usage. Navigate to the correct folder to use the command. Confirm installation is finished successfully or reinstall specific package or software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Bad option: Command parameter is not specified/recognized | You are required to type a parameter, or the parameter was incorrectly specified.                                               | Read the command again to check the typo or syntax and ensure correct command usage. If the terminal prompts the list of available parameters, type one of them following the command. Look up the command or function causing the error for proper usage.                                                                                                                                                             |
